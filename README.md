Searchlight
-------------
Searchlight is a system search and application launcher that can be launched anywhere! Take control of Spotlight!

iOS 8.x compatible! This package replaces AnySpot and ListLauncher7 for iOS 7

When the system search has no input or is just launched the user can display ‘Recent’, ‘Favorite’, and list all their applications. 
Recent: Never go to the app switcher again! Show the most recently launched applications. 
Favorites: Put your favorite apps at the top for quick and easy access!
Application List: Display all the applications on your phone, with alphabetized indexing!

Configure via settings. This package uses activator and it is strongly encouraged to disable Activator banners. 

Rotation/Landscape support are currently “experimental”.
